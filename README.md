## Getting Started with the Backend

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

### Steps

**Run the Backend server:**
   - Launch your code editor, `IntelliJ`.
   - Open the project located at `path/to/'Game-center BackEnd`.  
   - Find the main application class, which is typically annotated with`@SpringBootApplication`.
   - Click the green “Run” button (a play icon) in the top right corner of IntelliJ.


> **Note:** The server typically runs on `http://localhost:9191`. Check your terminal for any specific messages or logs.

## Getting Started with the Frontend

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or later recommended)
- npm (comes with Node.js)

### Steps

1. **Navigate to the Frontend Directory:**

   Open a new terminal window, and run:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/'Game-center FrontEnd'
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   Run the following command to install the frontend packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Launch the Website:**

   Start the frontend application by running:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   > **Note:** If your backend is running on port `3000`, the frontend will automatically change to run on a different port (e.g., `3001`). Check the terminal for the exact address.
